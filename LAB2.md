===

* Pairing encouraged (unless you feel _very_ solid in angular routing and components)
* Data API is `https://pet-store-401.herokuapp.com/api`
  * Added Auth endpoints:
    * GET `/api/auth/verify` (returns `{ sucess: true|false }`)
    * POST `/api/auth/signin` (returns `{ token: <token> }`)
    * POST `/api/auth/signup` (returns `{ token: <token> }`)
  * Token passed via header: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

## New Welcome/Home State

Optional: Add a welcome or home state that does not require auth, and has a call to action for main page

### User Auth

* Token and User Services
* `app.run` with subscription to `$stateChangeStart`
* Configure states to tell which need auth
* `app.config` with http interceptor
* Model Dialog or state for signin/signup
  * Associated components for sign in/up
* logout link

  
## Rubric *10pts*

* Services *3pts*
* Setup routes, http, and auth (run via `$stateChangeStart`) *3pts*
* Works Correctly *4pts*
